# Odin Recipes

This is a repository for the first project in [The Odin's Project] (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) curriculum.

# Objectives

1. Relearn how to create a simple website in HTML.
2. Create a simple recipe website that will link to a few recepies.
3. Utilize the content that have been taught so far:
    a) HTML boilerplate
    b) Text in HTML
    c) Lists in HTML
    d) Links and Images in HTML
4. Eventually use CSS to decorate the page when I get to that point in the curriculum.
