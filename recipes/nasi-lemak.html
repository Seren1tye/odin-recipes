        <p>Arguably <strong>THE</strong> Malaysian dish, Nasi Lemak is a popular dish
        that originates in Malaysia, being the go-to meal for Malaysians no matter the time.
        No matter what, Malaysians are united on their food and this is proof.</p>

        <p>Nasi Lemak is quite simple and you can add anything you want to this meal.
            Chicken? Beef? Veggies? The only limit is your creativity (and not making
            an awful meal).

    <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>

    <div class="description">
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups jasmine rice</li>
            <li>7 ounces coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 pandan leaves, cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>One 1-inch knob (25 g) fresh peeled ginger, julienned</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more to taste; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight</li>

            <h3 class="header">To Serve (optional):</h3>
            <li>Sambal tumis</li>
            <li>Fried ikan bilis (dried anchovies)</li>
            <li>Sliced hard-boiled eggs </li>
            <li>Fried peanuts</li>
            <li>Sliced cucumbers </li>
            <li>Fresh or frozen banana leaf</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
    <div class="description">
        <ol>
            <li>Set up a tiered steamer, filling the bottom section with about 3 inches of water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Line the steamer tier with cheesecloth.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place the rice in a strainer and rinse the grains under running water until the water is almost clear. Drain rice, then transfer to a 10-inch nonstick skillet and add the coconut milk, 7 ounces (200ml) water, pandan leaves, ginger, and salt. Cook on medium heat, stirring continuously, until it thickens like rice pudding, 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rice mixture to the cheesecloth-lined steamer tier and spread it in a roughly even layer. Set steamer tier over bottom section of boiling water, cover, and steam over medium heat until the grains are fully cooked, about 45 minutes; start checking rice doneness after 35 minutes of steaming. Once the rice reaches your preferred texture, turn off the heat and leave it to continue steaming, covered, until the steaming stops. The rice should be just cooked, with separate grains and a rich flavor of coconut.</li>
            <li>Serve with sambal tumis and other nasi lemak accompaniments, depending on your preference (note that it's typical to leave the pandan leaves in the nasi lemak, as it's understood they will be removed at the table by the diner; do not eat them). If desired, nasi lemak can be served on a banana leaf, which will contribute its own fragrance to the dish as the rice and toppings are eaten.</li>
        </ol>
